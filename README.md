A presentation on [Hadoop Streaming](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/HadoopStreaming.html) on Amazon [Elastic MapReduce (EMR)](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/). EMR allows you to very easily launch a Hadoop cluster for all your mapreduce needs.

You can easily view the [**presentation online**](presentation/README.md), or run it as a reveal.js presentation with `start_presentation.sh`.

This project has been presented on several events including:

- **2015-10-07**: Data-Intensive Programming (TIE-22306)
- **2015-02-18**: Post-Graduate Seminar on Pervasive Computing: Apache Hadoop (TIE-12206)

### Getting started

See the documentation in the [`src`](/src) directory. To invoke the AWS API, you will need to setup an account and get API keys. Running an EMR cluster may incur costs on your credit card.
